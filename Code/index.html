<body>

<!-- EP1 -->
<!-- 1) React is a JavaScript library not a framework, it does not impose an exhaustive application structure like frameworks do
     2) React uses one-way data binding and virtual DOM, whereas Angular uses two-way data binding and real DOM -->

<!-- 3)  index.html gets executed line by line if the script tag is placed above react script tags the react will not work -->
<!-- 4)  ONLY APPLICABLE FOR THE DIV WITH ID ROOT    And if there's something inside root div it will get replaced as soon as the execution of react script tags and app.js occurs -->

    <h2>heading above root</h2>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <h2>heading below root</h2>

<!-- 5) This means we can use react in small portion of page also only the div with root id consists react in it -->

<!-- 6) How to give heading using JS into html -->

    <!-- <script>
         
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World from jS";

        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);
    </script> -->

<!-- 7) How to inject react in the project 
     a) Using React CDN links -->


<!-- EP2 -->
<!-- 11) package.json will manage the package and dependencies which will be installed in our project -->
<!-- 12) package-lock.json will locks the version and keeps the record of it when the particular dependency is installed in the project-->
<!-- 13) package.json & package-lock.json are important files. Even if the node modules get's deleted it can be reinstalled easily by using the data of previous versions from package.json -->

<!-- 14) Node Modules are the collection of dependencies.And  are very huge in size -->
<!-- 15) No need to push Node modules on github as the size of node modules is very huge  -->
<!-- 16) .git-ignore file is used to ignore the things which a developer don't want to push to Github-->

<!-- 17) CDN links is not a preferred way to host a react app bcz fetching from CDN is costly as it have to fetch data from unpkg.com  -->
<!-- 18) And it will not be present in the package.json so if there's some updates it will be easy to update the dependencies -->
<!-- 19) So the best way to get react in our project is by installing it using npm i react (i is short form for install) -->
